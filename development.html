                <h1>idea creation and planning</h1>
                <p>Supply Chains began as a concept to create a strategy game that challenges players to build efficient transportation networks. 
                    The core idea focused on connecting resource depots with factories while navigating challenging terrain like rivers and water bodies. 
                    Early planning involved designing the tile-based system and establishing the fundamental mechanics for road and bridge placement.

                <h1>feedback and polishing</h1>
                <p>During development, feedback from friends played a significant role in refining the game's visual clarity and user experience. 
                    Initially, players had difficulty distinguishing depots from factories, leading to a complete redesign of building icons using 
                    distinct shapes and colors. This feedback-driven approach helped simplify the learning curve and made gameplay more approachable for new players.

                <h1>game & asset creation</h1>
                <p>The development process involved creating all game assets including tilesets for roads, bridges, buildings, and terrain. Multiple 
                    debugging sessions were required to resolve bridge validation logic, manage multi-coordinate tiles, and correct connectivity checking algorithms. 
                    The game was built using Python and Pygame, with assets stored and retrieved from GitHub repositories for easy access and updates.
