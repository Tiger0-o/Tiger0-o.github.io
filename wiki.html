                <h1>how to play supply chains?</h1>
                <p>Supply Chains is a strategic tile-placement game where your objective is to connect all factories to at least one supply depot using roads and bridges. 
                    Use the number keys (1-6) to cycle through different types of road and bridge tiles, and press R to rotate them before placement. 
                    Click to place tiles on the grid to create your transportation network.
                </p>
                <img src="../assets/buildingTiles.png" alt="buildingTiles" style="height: 10vh; padding: 0px 5%;">
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Roads cannot be placed on water tiles, while bridges are specifically designed for water crossings and must be 
                    anchored on land at both ends. Road tiles must form valid connections such as straight paths, corners, T-junctions, or intersections to function properly. 
                    Overlapping bridges and roads will automatically delete or replace existing tiles.
                </p>
            
            </div>

            <div id="challenges" class="specialformattingcausethisonelooksweird">
                <h1>strategy and environmental challenges</h1>
                <p>Navigate around impassable terrain such as mountains and water bodies while creating efficient transportation routes. 
                    The game presents randomly placed depots and factories that require strategic thinking to connect optimally. 
                    Players must consider terrain obstacles and plan their road networks to minimize resource costs.
                </p>
                <img src="../assets/tileSet.png" alt="buildingTiles" style="height: 10vh; padding: 0px 5%;">
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Environmental challenges include rivers that require bridge crossings, mountainous 
                    terrain that blocks direct paths, and the need to establish complete connectivity between all buildings. Each level presents unique 
                    terrain layouts that require different strategic approaches to achieve optimal solutions.
                </p>    
            </div>

            <div id="scoring" class="specialformattingcausethisonelooksweird">
                <h1>scoring and valid pathways</h1>
                <p>Players aim to achieve the highest possible score of 9999 by minimizing the number of placed tiles while still achieving 
                    full connectivity. The scoring system rewards efficient pathfinding and strategic placement. Future scoring implementations 
                    will consider total tiles placed (lower is better), road vs bridge ratio (bridges cost more), time taken (shorter is better), 
                    and overall efficiency of connections.
